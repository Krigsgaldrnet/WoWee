# Changelog

## [v2.0.29-preview] — 2026-07-23

### World
- **Hairline seams between terrain tiles are gone.** Each tile's edge vertices were built by subtracting the chunk and per-vertex steps from the tile corner, so a tile's far edge (`…×TILE − TILE`) and its neighbour's near edge (`(…−1)×TILE`) — mathematically the same point — rounded to slightly different float32 values. The sub-yard gap opened T-junction cracks that showed as thin lines, worst far from the map origin (across Kalimdor). Vertex XY is now a single multiply from the tile index, `TILE_SIZE × (32 − tile − step/128)`, so the shared edge is bit-identical on both sides and the tiles meet exactly — no mesh-overlap or scale hacks
- **Game objects went missing after leaving an area and coming back, for the rest of the session.** Walking away dropped every instance of a mailbox or chest model, and the 60-second unused-model reaper then evicted the model itself; the reload on return did not reliably produce a drawn object. Game object models are now pinned in the renderer, so the reap/reload cycle never happens for them. They are a small bounded set — one per display ID actually encountered — and ambient doodads are still reaped normally
- Game objects are exempt from the adaptive doodad render distance. That distance collapses to its densest-scene value in any populated area, which in a city means roughly 200 units, so mailboxes and chests vanished well inside the range the server still considered them visible. They now hold a 600-unit floor; frustum and occlusion culling are unaffected
- GPU cull results are matched back to instances by ID rather than array index. The visibility buffer is read a full frame-slot cycle after it is written, and instances are appended and swap-removed in between, so a respawned object landing at the volatile tail of the array could inherit the verdict of whatever transient object held that slot two frames earlier
- Game objects no longer take the HiZ occlusion test at all. A mailbox or chest sits flush against a wall or doorframe, exactly where the coarse depth pyramid reports a false occlusion; once culled it stops being drawn, so it never regains the last-frame depth that would clear the false verdict, and it stayed invisible in place until the camera moved. These small gameplay props now opt out of occlusion culling entirely (frustum and distance culling still bound them), so they cannot vanish while in view

### Lighting
- **Hearth fires, campfires and forges cast light.** Fires express their flame as particle emitters rather than a glow card, and the path that turns emitters into a light was gated on lantern-like models — so a fireplace full of burning wood lit nothing at all. Open flame now takes that path, with a wider, warmer light than a candle wick, and forges are classified as the contained fires they are
- **Forges rendered as black windows.** `BLACKSMITHFORGE.m2` is nothing but the fire in the hearth, an effect card on a black background, but the additive override that handles exactly that shape was gated on spell effects, so it drew opaque and filled the opening with a black rectangle. Its black backing is colour-keyed too: the texture is `ARMORREFLECT`, whose name carries none of the flame or glow tokens the colour-key hint looks for
- Lamps, torches and braziers gutter. Each fixture's phase is hashed from its own placement, so no two pulse together — a synchronised row of street lamps reads as a rendering artifact rather than firelight — and the guttering drives the light each one casts, not just its glow sprite, since the pool of light on the ground is what the eye actually reads as fire
- Darkshire's town hall clock face is lit by a fire behind it. WMO emissive was a flag tuned for Stormwind's lamp glass, far too bright for a clock face, and is now a level: the new one keeps normal daylight shading, adds a warm glow that fades up as the scene darkens, and wavers on three detuned sines so the flame never visibly loops. A tight sun highlight and a Fresnel sheen sell the pane of glass over the dial
- Hearth fire light no longer turns the surrounding brickwork orange. Local lights are unshadowed, so their radius is how far the glow reaches straight through whatever surrounds the fire; at 11 units a hearth lit its entire chimney from the inside out

### UI
- **Target-gated abilities (Execute, Hammer of Wrath, ...) grey out until the target qualifies, and fail with a useful reason.** These read Spell.dbc's TargetAuraState — e.g. "target below 20% health" — which the client never consulted, so the button looked castable and the failure just said "Target aurastate". The action button now dims (with a tooltip naming the requirement) while the target isn't in the needed state, and the cast-failed message reads "Target must be below 20% health." and the like
- **The reputation panel gained real tracking controls.** Right-clicking a faction now offers, alongside "Track on Rep Bar", an **At War** toggle (declares war / makes peace via CMSG_SET_FACTION_ATWAR, disabled on peace-forced factions) and an **Inactive** toggle (parks it via CMSG_SET_FACTION_INACTIVE). Inactive factions are hidden behind a "Show inactive" checkbox — which reports how many are parked — and render dimmed when shown
- **"Your auction of … has sold!" named the wrong item ("Item #0").** The owner-notification packet was parsed with a phantom `action` field, which pushed the item-entry read to an offset holding a zero padding word; the real `item_template` sits at offset 20. It now parses correctly (and always reads as "sold", since expiry and outbids arrive on their own opcodes)
- **Readable letter/note items resolve their `$`-tokens.** The item-text window drew the body raw, so a quest letter showed literal markup like "$g himself : herself;". It now runs the same placeholder replacer as quest and chat text, filling in gender ($g), player name ($n), line breaks ($b), and the rest
- **The achievements window shows each achievement's real icon** instead of a gold star. Achievement.dbc's IconID (added to the DBC layout) resolves through SpellIcon.dbc to the artwork, rendered as a bordered 32px icon with the name and point value beside it; a star placeholder still fills the slot while an icon streams in or if it's missing
- **Raid target markers never appeared on marked enemies.** Three separate faults stacked: `GameHandler` kept its own copy of the marks that nothing ever wrote, so the target frame, nameplates, minimap and party list all read zeros; the wire format was inverted, with the full list (which carries only the icons that are set, not a fixed eight) and the single-mark form (which leads with the setter's GUID on WotLK but not on classic or TBC) swapped; and the marks were drawn as text symbols the font has no code points for, so they rendered as '?' boxes. Marks now use Blizzard's icon artwork, floating above the unit as in the original client, and are covered by tests across both wire layouts
- Solo players can set target markers. The server only broadcasts them to a group, so marking while ungrouped did nothing and the feature could not be used, or tested, without a second player. Grouped marking stays server-authoritative
- The DPS meter sits under the target frame instead of near the bottom of the screen, and can be dragged; the position persists, and right-click returns it home
- **The bank window lists the cost of each unpurchased bag slot.** The "Buy Slot" button gave no price and let you click slots out of order; it now shows the gold cost per slot from `BankBagSlotPrices.dbc`, and only the next slot in sequence is buyable — later ones are locked with their price shown. Buying now goes through an "are you sure?" confirmation that names the cost, rather than spending gold on a single click
- The bank has a Sort button that arranges the main bank and every bank bag by quality, then item ID, then stack size — the same ordering as the backpack Sort, driven client-side one swap per frame
- The bank can show every slot as one continuous grid via a "Combine bags" toggle, instead of splitting each bank bag into its own labeled section
- **Spell descriptions resolve their `$`-tokens everywhere, not just in the talent panel.** Buff/aura tooltips, the spellbook, and item "Use/Equip" effect lines showed raw markup like "Stamina and Spirit increased by $s1" or "Restores $/5;s1 health per second". Token substitution now lives on a shared `GameHandler::formatSpellDescription` used by all of them, and additionally handles the `$/N;` division token (food regen) alongside the base-point, duration, cross-spell, and plural/gender forms
- **Spell tooltips now show the full effect Description instead of the terse one-liner.** The client read Spell.dbc's short `Tooltip` string, so a food item said only "Restores 3 health per second" and never mentioned the Well Fed buff it grants. Descriptions now come from the `Description` column (falling back to `Tooltip`), so food reads "Restores 17 health over 18 sec … become well fed and gain 2 Stamina and Spirit for 15 min."
- **Talent tooltips describe what the talent actually does.** The talent panel read Spell.dbc's `Tooltip` column, whose index in the layouts pointed at an empty locale slot, so hovering a talent showed only its name and rank. Tooltips now pull the spell `Description` (added to every expansion's DBC layout at its verified column) and resolve WoW's `$`-token grammar against live spell data — `$s/$o/$m/$M` base points and `$d` durations, including cross-spell `$<spellId>` references like `$14201d`, plus `$l`/`$g` plural and gender forms — so "receive a $14201s1% damage bonus for $14201d" reads "receive a 4% damage bonus for 12 sec". Tokens with no local source (`$h` proc chance, `$t` period) are stripped cleanly rather than shown raw. An unlearned talent shows its rank-1 effect under "Effect:"
- **Spell.dbc `Tooltip` (and TBC `Rank`) columns pointed at the wrong offset.** The WotLK layout's `Tooltip` and the TBC layout's `Rank`/`Tooltip` indices assumed the wrong locale-block stride, landing on empty columns; they now point at the verified enUS strings, so spell rank text and short tooltips resolve on those clients too
- **The auction "Create Auction" item picker lists everything you can sell.** It only walked the 16-slot base backpack, so items in equipped bags never appeared; it now enumerates the backpack and every equipped bag, and posts the chosen item by its server GUID so any container works
- **New mail announces itself.** Receiving mail while online — or logging in with mail already waiting — now prints "You have new mail." to chat and plays a notification cue, on top of the existing minimap indicator; it fires once per unread state rather than repeating while the mail sits unread
- The keyring is interactive and always visible when enabled
- AddOns can be enabled and disabled from a manager on character select, and unimplemented addon widget methods fall back to no-ops rather than erroring
- The target frame no longer stays stuck at a previous target's width

### Quests
- Quest giver markers refresh as soon as an objective completes, rather than only after leaving and re-entering the area. Sweeps are coalesced behind a one-second cooldown, since one request fans out to a packet per nearby giver and completion events arrive in bursts
- Key-locked chests open by using the key item on them; unlocked and quest-gated chests open instead of being refused

### Audio
- Capital City Bells volume is independent of the ambient slider

### Character
- Barber shop appearance changes apply without a restart

## [v2.0.7-preview] — 2026-07-12

### Camera
- **Hills no longer clip through the third-person camera.** Terrain was only ever a floor clamp at the camera's final position, so a rise *between* the character and the camera sliced straight through the view and the clamp just popped the camera upward after the fact. The camera ray now marches the terrain heightfield (coarse ~1.25-unit steps, then bisection for a tight limit) and the resulting distance feeds the same asymmetric pull-in/recover smoothing as the WMO wall raycast. Worst case is ~28 bilinear height lookups a frame — negligible. Pull-in snaps 1:1 while the mouse or turn keys are actively rotating, since the 60 ms ease was exactly the window where a fast swing into a hillside still dipped underground
- The terrain march is skipped inside interior WMOs (terrain above a tunnel is not a real occluder) and when the pivot itself sits below the heightfield (caves, WMO basements, ADT holes), so it cannot pin the camera to first-person where the heightfield is irrelevant
- X now dives while swimming instead of toggling sit, water-exit assists are suppressed while diving, and the swim-depth gate only applies on water entry — deliberate dives can go arbitrarily deep

### UI
- Crafting panel reagent lines show live have/need counts, recounted every frame so consumption is visible mid-craft; Create/Create All disable when any reagent is short

---

## [v2.0.6-preview] — 2026-07-12

### Networking
- **Stop dropping every packet that has no payload.** `handlePacket()` ignored any packet whose body was empty, but `getSize()` is the payload length and the opcode is carried separately — for the many opcodes with no payload, the opcode *is* the message. All of them were swallowed before dispatch, which is also why no "unhandled opcode" warning ever fired for them. Eight registered opcodes were affected:
  - `SMSG_LOGOUT_COMPLETE` — the server logged the character out and moved on while the client waited forever, so the logout countdown ended and nothing happened
  - `SMSG_LOGOUT_CANCEL_ACK` — a cancelled logout was never confirmed
  - `SMSG_ATTACKSWING_NOTINRANGE` / `_BADFACING` / `_DEADTARGET` / `_CANT_ATTACK` — none of the four auto-attack errors ever reached the player
  - `SMSG_PET_BROKEN`, `SMSG_INVALIDATE_PLAYER`

### Logout
- `/quit` and `/exit` now leave the game when the server confirms the logout; `/logout` and `/camp` return to character select. They were all aliases of one command that did neither
- `/logout` was not a command at all: `aliases()` is the complete name list and it only listed camp, quit and exit, so `/help` had been advertising a command that silently did nothing
- The logout pose is a sit again. The server stuns the player to root them for the countdown, and we mapped `UNIT_FLAG_STUNNED` straight to the stun animation, which played over the sit and left the character slumped

### UI
- The breath, fatigue and feign-death bars count down. `SMSG_START_MIRROR_TIMER` hands the client a remaining time and a scale and the server then only re-syncs on change, but nothing ticked the value — so the breath bar sat frozen while you drowned. The sub-millisecond remainder is carried, so the timer does not run slow at high frame rates
- Fix the tail of `SMSG_START_MIRROR_TIMER`: it is paused(1) + spellId(4), not the reverse

---

## [v2.0.5-preview] — 2026-07-12

### Build
- **The build was shipping shaders compiled on 4 April.** `compile_shaders()` wrote its SPIR-V into the runtime tree, and the POST_BUILD step then copied the whole source `assets/` directory over it — including the `.spv` files tracked in git. The stale committed shaders won every build, so three months of GLSL edits never reached the GPU. Seven shaders were affected: `character.frag`, `character.vert`, `terrain.frag`, `water.frag`, `m2_particle.frag`, and both FSR2 compute shaders. Shaders now compile in place next to the GLSL, so the tracked `.spv` and the shader the GPU runs cannot diverge

### Character Select
- Preview is larger (panel widened, render target raised to 640x800), shows the character's equipped weapons, and stands them in their racial glue scene — Stormwind for humans, Durotar for orcs, and so on
- Scene backdrops are placed from the camera and attachment point the M2 carries (M2Loader now parses cameras); their geometry sits hundreds of units from the model origin, so nothing else can position them
- Weapons and enchant visuals no longer leak between characters: weapon attachment ran past an early return for characters whose body skin could not be composited, and fixed model ids meant every character after the first was handed the first one's weapon model

### Rendering
- Backdrops are no longer erased by the character alpha heuristics. Stormwind's walls are DXT5 with an unused alpha channel (mean alpha 17/255, every texel below the cutoff), and inferring a cutout from "the texture has alpha" discarded the whole building, leaving the sky showing through it

### Item Enhancements
- Temporary weapon enchants show as the weapon's icon with its remaining time, in the right slot. SMSG_ITEM_ENCHANT_TIME_UPDATE carries the item's *enchantment* slot (TEMP_ENCHANTMENT_SLOT = 1), not the equipment slot, so every temporary enchant was labelled "Off Hand" — even on a two-hander

### Merged
- Extract `buildFactionHostilityMap()` into a shared free function (#95)

---

## [v2.0.4-preview] — 2026-07-12

### UI
- Show the build version and date bottom-left on the login screen and right-aligned in the settings window
- `core/version.hpp` is generated from `git describe --tags --abbrev=0` by `cmake/GitVersion.cmake`, so the client always reports the last tagged release. It regenerates on every build rather than only when cmake reconfigures, and rewrites the header only when the version actually changed
- The build stamp is a date, not a timestamp: a clock time would change the header every build and force a full recompile of everything including it

### Build
- Un-ignore `cmake/*.cmake`. The repo's blanket `*.cmake` rule targets CMake build output and would have silently excluded the new hand-written module from the tree, breaking a fresh clone

---

## [v2.0.3-preview] — 2026-07-12

### Item Enhancements (sharpening stones, weightstones, weapon oils)
- Send TARGET_FLAG_ITEM in CMSG_USE_ITEM. Item-enhancement consumables cast their spell onto another item, but the client only ever wrote a unit or self target, so the server dropped the cast and the item did nothing
- Using such an item now reads the on-use spell's Spell.dbc Targets mask and arms an item-targeting cursor; the next item clicked (in bags or equipped) receives the enchant. Escape or right-click cancels
- Add the Spell.dbc `Targets` column to all four expansion layouts (Classic 13, TBC 14, WotLK 16)
- Weapon enchant visuals: resolve SpellItemEnchantment → ItemVisuals → ItemVisualEffects and attach the effect M2 (e.g. the sharpening-stone glint) to the weapon model's item-visual attachment points, rendered additive and unlit
- Applying an enchant now marks equipment dirty even though the displayInfoId is unchanged, so the visual appears without re-equipping

### Bug Fixes
- Read enchant names from the correct SpellItemEnchantment.dbc column. The name moved across expansions (Vanilla 10, TBC 13, WotLK 14) but every caller used field 8, an integer column that getString() treated as a string-block offset — so names came back garbled mid-string ("Sharpened (+2 Damage)" surfaced as "ockbiter 3"). Resolved from the record width via `detectEnchantmentNameField()`

### Tests
- New `test_use_item_packet` suite: CMSG_USE_ITEM SpellCastTargets encoding for WotLK, Classic and TBC (item, unit, and self targeting)
- DBC tests for enchant name/ItemVisual column detection and the enchant → effect-model resolution chain

---

## [v1.9.7-preview] — 2026-07-09

### Bug Fixes
- Fix world login pipeline: login-critical opcodes (AUTH_CHALLENGE, AUTH_RESPONSE, CHAR_ENUM, CHAR_CREATE, CHAR_DELETE, WARDEN_DATA) now fall back to hardcoded wire values when opcode table lookup fails, preventing "Unhandled world opcode: 0x1ec" blocking character list retrieval (issue #87)
- OpcodeTable::loadFromJson() now loads into temporaries and only swaps on success — a failed reload no longer wipes the working table
- Integrity hash is now build-aware: Classic-era DLLs (fmod.dll, ijl15.dll, dbghelp.dll, unicows.dll) only required for builds <=6005 or Turtle; TBC/WotLK clients hash only the .exe

### Animation & Camera
- Rework strafing to use walk/run animations with SpineLow bone torso twist instead of dedicated strafe/run-left/right animations
- Add `setInstanceTorsoYaw()` to CharacterRenderer for per-instance upper-body rotation
- Camera smoothing snaps 1:1 while actively dragging or keyboard turning instead of always lerping, reducing perceived input lag
- Add `travelYaw_` tracker to CameraController for movement vector heading separate from camera facing
- Mount strafing uses MOUNT_RUN_LEFT/RIGHT animations when available
- Default mouse invert changed to off

### Tests
- Add "OpcodeTable failed reload preserves existing data" test case
